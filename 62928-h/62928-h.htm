<h4><a id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h4>


<p>The children of nowadays are different in
many of their likes and dislikes, from the
children of ten years ago. This change of
attitude is noticeable as much in the world of
children's poetry as it is in other things.</p>

<p>In my experience of teaching I have found
the children delight in two distinct types of
verses. These are the humorous type and the
imaginative poetical type&mdash;but the humour
must be from the child's point of view and not
from the "grown-up's"&mdash;a very different
thing. And the imagination in the second
type of poem must be clear and whimsical,
otherwise the appeal fails and the child does
not respond.</p>

<p>As I found a lack of suitable poems of the
types I wanted, I began to write them myself
for the children under my supervision, taking,
in many cases, the ideas, humorous or whimsical,
of the children themselves, as the theme
of the poems. Finding them to be successful,
I continued, until the suggestion was made to
me that many children, other than those in
my own school, might enjoy hearing and
learning the poems. Accordingly this collection
of verses is put forward in the hope that
it will be a source of sincere enjoyment to the
little people of the world.</p>

<h4><a id="ROSAMUNDA">ROSAMUNDA</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">In the garden very early</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Rosamunda's walking,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And to her surprise she hears</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Lots of fairies talking.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She looks around but cannot see</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Where they can be hiding;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Not on any butterfly</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Nor bee, are they a-riding.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She goes to where the tulips grow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And finds a sight of wonder,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">For out pop fairy elves and say,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">"Good-morning, Rosamunda!"</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="DISAPPOINTMENT">DISAPPOINTMENT</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">Once I found a fairy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">In my cup of tea.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She was nearly drowned</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And wet as wet could be.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I picked her out and dried her</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And asked her if she'd stay;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">"Oh, no," she said, "<i>I mustn't</i>,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And off she flew away.</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="ON_STRIKE">ON STRIKE</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">My dollies are so naughty,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">I'm afraid they've gone on strike;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">They won't let me undress them,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">But just do what they like.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">They say they want a penny</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">To spend on Saturday,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And 'less I let them have it,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">They'll not join in my play.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I can't let them behave so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">They'll never grow up right&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">But I know they will be sorry</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">When I don't kiss them good-night.</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="FAIRY_SIGHT">FAIRY SIGHT</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">If you want to see a fairy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">In the middle of the night,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Wrap the blanket round you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And shut your eyes up tight.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Say "Akral dafarray!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And open your right eye,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And (if you've been a good child)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A fairy flutters by!</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="A_FAIRY_NECKLACE">A FAIRY NECKLACE</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">The rain had rained all morning,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And then the sun shone fair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And all the garden glittered</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">With raindrops everywhere!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">There were raindrops on the grasses,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And raindrops on the trees,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And how they shook and shivered,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Like diamonds, in the breeze!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And oh, I saw a fairy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Come flying right by me;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She shook a score of raindrops,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">From off the hazel tree.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She slung them on a spider's thread,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A necklace made of rain!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She clasped them round her little neck,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And off she flew again!</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="PAYING_A_CALL">PAYING A CALL</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">I put on my hat with the band of blue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And my frock with the frilly lace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I took my sunshade, and held it up,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">To keep the sun off my face.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I thought I'd go calling like Mother does,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And have pretty cakes for tea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And sit on the edge of a chair and talk</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">With a tea-cup on my knee.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I walked all along the sunny road,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Till I came to Mrs. Leroy's.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I climbed the steps, and I rang the bell&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">It made such a jangley noise.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And then I suddenly felt afraid,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And couldn't think what I would say</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">When they opened the door&mdash;so I jumped</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">the steps,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And I ran back home all the way.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Nurse saw me coining in my best frock,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And oh, how she scolded me!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And that's why I'm wearing an overall now,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And not having jam for tea.</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="BEFORE_BREAKFAST">BEFORE BREAKFAST</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">I go round the garden early, when the grass is</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">bright with dew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And I have to put goloshes on my feet.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I'll tell you all I do there, right away from</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">people's view,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">When the world is half-awake and very</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">sweet.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I shake the lady hollyhocks to make the bees</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">fly out,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And I see how much they've grown since</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">yesterday.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I pop the fattest fuchsia buds, if gardener's</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">not about,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And I blow the dandelion clocks away.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I smell the honeysuckle and the lavender as</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">well,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">I take the rose-leaves fallen down beyond;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">They're pink and white and beautiful, just like</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">a fairy shell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And I save them up for sailing on the pond.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I stand upon the mossy wall, and smell the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">new mown hay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And I feel the wind that blows the clouds</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">along;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I think there never, <i>never</i> could be such a</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">lovely day&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And then, I hear that horrid breakfast gong!</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="GOBLINS">GOBLINS</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">When I am cross as I can be, and nothing's</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">ever right,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Then Mummy says there's naughty goblins,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">hiding out of sight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Who try to make me do what's wrong, and try</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">to make me bad,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">They like me to forget things, and make other</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">people sad.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I've never found them anywhere, I don't know</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">where to look,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I've only seen them in the pages of my</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">picture-book,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">But oh, I'm <i>sure</i> they're all about in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">everybody's house,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Little creepy-crawley things, as quiet as a</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">mouse.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">When cook forgets to put the sugar in the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Sunday cake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And gardener breaks the barrow-wheel, and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">loses Daddie's rake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And Nurse is very cross indeed, and won't let</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">me go out,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I always know those nasty little goblins are</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">about.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I play next-door with Peter, and there's</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">goblins even there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Altho' it's such a lovely house, I can't think</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">how they dare,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">But often Peter's Daddie is as grumpy as can</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">All over nothing, so the goblins must be there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">you see.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Whenever things go very wrong, I hide myself</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">To try and see those goblins, and I'm sure I</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">shall some day.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And if they bother you at all, you try and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">catch them, too,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And <i>will</i> you save them up for me to look at,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">if you do?</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="THE_FAIRYS_BEDTIME">THE FAIRY'S BEDTIME</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">Just before they go to bed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The fairy babes are told</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">To sit upon their toadstools, and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">To be as good as gold.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">So down they sit, all in a ring,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">It's supper-time, they know,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">For look, their little acorn cups</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Are standing in a row.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">A fairy fills the little cups,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">With dew and honey sweet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And gives one to each little babe</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">With something nice to eat.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Then off into the trees they fly</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And curl themselves up tight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Inside a leaf that's soft and warm,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And there they sleep all night.</span></p>

<h4><a id="POPPIES">POPPIES</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">Up the lane behind our house</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A little hill you climb,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And at the top on either side</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">There is in Summer time&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">A cornfield waving in the wind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Where poppies shake their head</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And peep at you between the corn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A glowing dancing red&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I'll tell you what I did one day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">When nurse was cross with me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And pulled my hair back in a plait,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">As tight as tight could be&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I crept up to the swaying corn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And in the poppies there</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I sat down by myself, and then</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">I undid all my hair!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I picked some gleaming poppies red,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The biggest I could find,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I wound them tightly in my curls,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And some hung down behind.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I walked about so very grand</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Till it began to rain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">When one by one the poppies fell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And I went home again.</span></p>

<h4><a id="A_QUEER_BUTTERFLY">A QUEER BUTTERFLY</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">I caught a lovely butterfly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">In Marianna's net.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">It was the sweetest blue and gold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The prettiest I'd seen yet.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">But Marianna came and said</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The butterfly should be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Not mine, but <i>hers</i>, because the net</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Belonged to her, not me.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">We quarrelled hard, and didn't stop,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Until my frock was torn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And then she pointed down to where</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The net lay, on the lawn.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">The butterfly was creeping out</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And spread its wings of blue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And then <i>stood up</i>, just fancy that!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">You'd hardly think it true!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">We saw then what it really was,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A fairy, come to play,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And all because we quarrelled so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">She fluttered right away.</span></p>

<h4><a id="LOVELY_FROCKS">LOVELY FROCKS</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">In my Mummy's wardrobe, there are lots of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">lovely frocks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">I know because I've seen them hanging</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">there;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">There's purple, and there's orange, and a frilly</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">one of blue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And a yellow that is shiny like her hair.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">The satin frocks make Mummy look just like a</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">fairy Queen&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">But she can't cuddle me at all in those&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And when she wears a silken frock, it rustles</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">like the trees&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">But I can't kiss her 'cos I spoils the bows.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And tho' I love her pretty dresses, 'cos she</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">looks so grand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">What I like really best of all to see,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Is when she's in the garden, wearing <i>just</i> an</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">overall&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And comes to romp and play about with me.</span></p>

<h4><a id="THE_WITCHS_BALLOONS">THE WITCH'S BALLOONS</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">Opposite the nursery sat a woman old and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">brown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I should think she was the very oldest person</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">in the town,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She sold balloons to children as they passed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">her corner there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She was very cross and horrid and she had a</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">nasty stare.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I looked at her one morning, on a very</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">windy day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And she saw me and she stared at me in such</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">a nasty way,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I felt afraid, and certain sure that she must be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">a witch,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And keep all sorts of stolen treasures hidden</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">in a ditch.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And as I looked at her, and she was staring up</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">at me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I saw a fairy flying low from out the chestnut</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">tree,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She held a little knife, and oh, she cut the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">strings right through,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">That held the big balloons together, then away</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">she flew!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And off went all the purple ones and off went</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">all the pink,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">A-flying in the air as high as ever you could</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">think,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Around the chimney pots, and right away up</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">in the sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Until they bumped into the clouds, a-sailing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">slowly by.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And then I looked to see what that old woman</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">had to say,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">But there wasn't any sign of her, she'd</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">vanished right away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She <i>must</i> have been a wicked witch, and by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">the fairies slain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">For tho' I've looked each morning, she has</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;"><i>never</i> come again.</span></p>

<h4><a id="FAIRY_MUSIC">FAIRY MUSIC</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">I found a little fairy flute</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Beneath a harebell blue;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I sat me down upon the moss</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And blew a note or two.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And as I blew the rabbits came</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Around me in the sun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And little mice and velvet moles</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Came creeping, one by one.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">A swallow perched upon my head,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A robin on my thumb,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">The thrushes sang in tune with me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The bees began to hum.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I loved to see them all around</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And wished they'd always stay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">When down a little fairy flew</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And <i>snatched</i> my flute away!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And then the swallow fluttered off,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And gone were all the bees,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">The rabbits ran, and I was left</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Alone among the trees!</span></p>

<h4><a id="THE_LITTLE_FOLK_ON_THE_HILL">THE LITTLE FOLK ON THE HILL</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">Right on the top of the Feraling Hill</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">There's a queer little seat made of stone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And sometimes I climb up the heathery slope.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And sit in the wind all alone.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Nobody knows why the little seat's there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">(It's almost too tiny for me)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">But I love to squeeze into it on a clear day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And look over the hills to the sea.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Sometimes I've sat there and heard funny</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">sounds</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And voices, and tho' I've kept still,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I've only seen one of the queer Little Folk</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">That I <i>know</i> live inside of the hill.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">For once I came quietly up to the stone&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And on it sat one of the Folk!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">He was looking across all the hills to the sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">But he vanished away when I spoke.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And that's how <i>I</i> know why the little seat's</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And why it's small even for me;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">The Folk put it there in the wind, for <i>they love</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">To look over the hills to the sea.</span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 19em;">bumble-bee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And then&mdash;I just looked up to see the clouds</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">go sailing by&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And oh, I saw the <i>moon</i>, in daytime! and I</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;"><i>can't</i> think why!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Such funny things keep happ'ning, and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">they've happened all to-day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">First, I found a weeny mouse, all cuddled in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">the hay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Then at home we've got a baby, from <i>I</i> don't</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And now I find the moon at <i>tea-time</i>, sitting in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">the air!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I'm sure it's wrong, because the Bible says it's</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">meant for night,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And look, it hides behind the clouds&mdash;it knows</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">it isn't right.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Now there it comes! Oh, silly moon, you make</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">the sun look fine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">'Cos bumping up against the clouds has</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 18em;">April hangs a hundred sunny raindrops in the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">lane,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She can wash the sky with woolly clouds of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">purest white,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And gaily dress it up in rainbows, curving out</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">of sight.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Oh, April hangs the chestnut trees with spires</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">of white and pink,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And kisses all the primroses along the river's</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">brink,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She peeps into the tiny nests where eggs are</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">hidden well,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And searches out the purple violets growing in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">the dell.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 19em;">against the sky</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And chases all the bob-tail rabbits scuttling</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">gaily by,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She dances with the meadow cowslips, drooping</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">heads of gold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Oh, April is the sweetest month that any year</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 18em;">With whispering rushes around,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">That murmur of things they have seen.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I once lay and listened all night,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And heard why the pool lies alone;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Not even a fairy goes near</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And only the sad rushes moan.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I heard how there once lived a witch,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Who weaved wicked spells night and day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And used the pool's purplish deeps</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">For things which I wouldn't dare say.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Then one day she vanished and went,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And never was seen any more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">But silent and still lay the pool,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And darker than ever before.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">No fairy knows what the pool holds,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And none guesses what secrets lie</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Hid safely away in its deeps,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">But shuddering, all pass it by.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Take heed when you go through the wood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And pass where the pool lies alone&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Not even a fairy goes near,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 19em;">They have a lot to do.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I want to go out in the fields</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Where all the daisies grow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And watch the little breezes bend</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The grasses to and fro.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I want to watch the butterflies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And hear the cuckoo call,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I'd cuckoo back to see if he</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Would answer me at all.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">The buttercups are shaking gold</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And look thro' my window pane,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And find the snow on the trees and fields,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">I get the Feeling again.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">When a great big wave comes sweeping up</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">On a stormy and windy tide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And crashes against the rocks in spray,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">I get the Feeling inside.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I once told Nannie just how I felt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">But I'm not going to tell her again.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;"><i>She</i> didn't know at all what I meant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">She called my Feeling a <i>pain!</i></span></p>

<h4><a id="THE_NAUGHTY_GNOME">THE NAUGHTY GNOME</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">A little gnome in Fairyland</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Once found a pot of glue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And he of course began to think</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">What mischief he could do!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">He smeared the toadstools, one and all,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Whereon the fairies sat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And oh, how cross they were to find</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A naughty trick like that!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">He dropped some glue upon the grass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">To catch the fairies' feet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">When there came by the Fairy King</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And Queen with all their suite.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">The King walked straight upon the glue</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And found he couldn't stir!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Then came the frightened gnome, and cried,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">"Oh, please have mercy, Sir!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I didn't mean to catch <i>your</i> feet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Within my sticky glue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">But please forgive me and I'll find</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Some better thing to do!"</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">"I'll pardon you," the King replied,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">"But harken what I say,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Go, use your glue on <i>chestnut</i> buds,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">To keep the frost away."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">So in the chestnuts every spring</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The gnome works all day long,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And if you touch a bud, you'll find</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">His glue is <i>very</i> strong!</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="SIX_OCLOCK">SIX O'CLOCK</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">We always wake at six o'clock,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">When Nurse is still asleep;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She's hidden under all the clothes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Her breathes are loud and deep.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">We mustn't talk till seven strikes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And so we just turn round</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And hear the milk-carts going by,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">They have a tinny sound.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I look up at the ceiling, and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">I count the cracks I see,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And all the flies upon the wall;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Once there were <i>twenty-three!</i></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Teddie pulls out feathers from</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The eiderdown, and blows</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">With all his might, to make them drop</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">On top of Nurse's nose.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I breathe on all the brassy nobs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">That feel so very cold;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">They go quite dull till Teddie rubs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And makes them shine like gold.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And now I've told you all these things,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">If you wake early, too,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And mustn't talk till seven strikes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;"><i>You'll</i> know just what to do.</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="THE_IMPS_MISTAKE">THE IMP'S MISTAKE</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">As Anna slept beside the fire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">An imp as black as soot</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Came down the chimney in a bound,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And landed by her foot!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">He looked at her black shining shoe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A frown came on his face,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">He thought it was a piece of coal</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A-tumbled from its place!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And so he started tugging hard</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">To put it back again</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Upon the fire, when Anna woke</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And gave a cry of pain!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">"You naughty little imp," she cried,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">"Just leave my foot alone!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And in a trice the imp had jumped</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And up the chimney flown!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">So when you're sitting by the fire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">It's better, on the whole,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">To keep awake, in case that imp</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Should think <i>your</i> shoes are coal!</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="PUT_TO_BED">PUT TO BED</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">The sun is shining hot and bright,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The gardener's mowing grass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">He's doing it with all his might,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">I hear his footsteps pass.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Nurse put me here in bed alone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Because I've not been good;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I think her heart is hard as stone&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">I didn't think she would.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I haven't been so very bad,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">I'll tell you what I've done.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I took a pencil that I had,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A lovely orange one.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I drew a splendid pattern round</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The dining room and hall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And trees that grew up from the ground,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Right up the nursery wall.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I'd started on a giant's head,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">I know just how they're made,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">When Nurse came in, so cross and red,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">It made me feel afraid.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I never had behaved, she said,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">So wickedly before;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She made me go upstairs to bed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And then she banged the door.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">She took my toys and books and ball,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And all the bricks I'd built;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">There's nothing here that's nice at all,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">'Cept Grannie's patchwork quilt!</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="THE_MERRY_BREEZE">THE MERRY BREEZE</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">Round about the orchard went the merry</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">little breeze,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Playing with the butterflies and teasing all</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">the bees,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Sending showers of apple-blossom down upon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">the ground,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And spilling half the dew-drops from the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">grasses all around.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">He ruffled up the feathers of the ducks a-sailing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">by,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And hustled all the lazy clods that floated in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">the sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">He swung the beeches to and fro, then darted</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">off again</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">To dry the shiny puddles scattered down along</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">the lane.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">The chimney smoke he twisted in the queerest</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">kind of way,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Until at last the little breeze was weary of his</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">play;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">He crept back to the orchard, where the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">daffodillies peep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And there it was I found him lying, curled up</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">fast asleep!</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="AN_ACCIDENT">AN ACCIDENT</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">We've a little summer house</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">With a pointed top,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And on it, watching us at play,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The fairies often stop.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">But now we've done a dreadful thing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And frightened them away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Because, by accident, our ball</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Struck two of them to-day.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">It bounced upon the summer house,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And hurt the fairies there;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">They flew away with cries of pain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And said it wasn't fair.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Each day we watch our summer house</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And watch the pointed top.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">But now, tho' fairies fly around,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">They <i>never</i> come to stop.</span></p>


<p><br /></p>

<h4><a id="A_HAPPY_ENDING">A HAPPY ENDING</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 18em;">I found a ship upon the sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">All ready waiting there for me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">So in I jumped and off we sped,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">To gleaming waters far ahead.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">But soon a wind came moaning by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And clouds filled all the sunny sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">The sea was speckled with the rain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And my ship rolled and rolled again.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">The waves crashed grandly on the deck.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">The sails dripped rain-drops down my neck,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Then straight ahead, I spied a rock,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And braced myself to meet the shock&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Crash! we struck, and there we stayed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">While rain and storm around us played;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">The ship at once began to fill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And down and down we sank&mdash;until</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I yelled in fear and clutched the side,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Half-drowning in the racing tide.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">And just as mast and rigging broke,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I found myself in bed&mdash;and WOKE!</span></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
